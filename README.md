# Flask Calculator

Created a Flask Calculator which contains 2 types of Calculators -
I. Simple Calculator - It can perform operations with Simple Mathematical Functions like Addition, Subtraction, MUltiplication & Division.
II. Advanced Calculator - It can perform operations with Advanced Mathematical Functions like log, cos, sin, tan etc.

It is made by using Flask module in Python.
For the Designing part, I used Bootstrap Framework for the CSS Styling.
